Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods  and tools to develop and maintain high -quality software systems It ensures that software is reliable ,efficient, meets user requirements .
Importance 
1Quality and reliability
2Efficiency 
3Scalability
4Cost effectiveness


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Software Crisis(1960s-1970)-higlighted the need for structured software development methodologies due to frequent project failures 
Introduction to Structured Programming(1970)-improved code readability and maintainability by using control structures 
3.Emergence of Agile Methodologies 1990-2000s -promoted iterative development,flexibility and customer collaboration



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-Define project goals,scope and feasibility 
2.Requirement Analysis-Gather and document user requirements 
3.Design- create software architecture and design specifications 
4.Implementation(coding)-write the actual code
5.Testing-verify that the software works as intended
6.Deployment -release the software to the users 
7.Maintenance - update and inprove the software over time 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall 
a)Linear and Sequential-each phase must be completed before the next begins 
b)Clear Requirements-best for projects with well defined requirements 
Example* building a bridge where requirements are unlikely to change
Agile
a)Iterative and Incremental-development occurs in small in small iterative cycles 
b)Flexibility -adapts to changing requirements 
Example *Developing a mobile app where user feedback is continuously incorporated 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer 
a)Design and execute test plans
b)Identify and report bugs 
c)Ensure software meets quality standards
2.Quality Assurance Engineer 
a)Design and Execute test plans 
b)Identify and report bugs 
c)Ensure software meets quality standards
3Project Manager 
a)Plan and oversee the project 
b)Cordinate team activities 
c)Ensure project goals and deadlines are met 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs
Provide tools for writing testing and debugging code Example Visual Studio
VCS 
Track changes to code and manage versions Example Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Managing complexity- use modular design and abstraction 
b)Meeting deadlines -Employ agile methodologies for better time management 
c)Ensuring Quality-implement through testing and code reviews 
d)Keeping up with technology-continuous learning and professional development 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit testing-Test individual testing for correctness 
b) Integration testing -ensures that different components work together 
c) System Testing- validates the complete and integrated software 
d)Acceptance Testing - confirms the software meets user requirements 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering refers to the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with AI models
Importance
Accuracy-ensures that the AI provides relevant and accurate responses 
Efficiency-reduces the need for multiple iterations 
User experience-chances the overall interactions with AI systems


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt example-"Tell me about software"
Improved Prompt"Explain the key principles of software engineering and it's importance in the technology industry ."
Improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the topic (software engineering)the focus(key principles) and the context (importance in the technology industry) leading to a more targeted and useful response
